Imagine protecting your content with a personalized watermark with the click of a button. Our Adobe Express add-on, Watermarker, generates and applies a watermark using your name and logo directly onto your current page. It doesn't matter if you're an amateur or professional. Watermarker will ensure that your content remains distinctly yours.
